# Forge

A multi-agent software development framework that builds, tests, and verifies code through disciplined orchestration.

**Version:** 03252026  
**Architecture:** Agent Skills Open Standard (2026)

---

## Philosophy

> "Without detailed task descriptions, agents duplicate work, leave gaps, or fail to find necessary information." — Anthropic

Forge solves this by:
1. **Separating WHO from HOW** — Agents define identity; Skills define procedures
2. **No self-verification** — Each agent's work is checked by another
3. **Concrete contracts** — Actual paths, not placeholders
4. **File as deliverable** — Work lives in files, not responses

## Agents

| Agent | Responsibility | Model | Cannot |
|-------|----------------|-------|--------|
| @code-executor | Implement code per spec | sonnet | Write tests, make design decisions |
| @test-writer | Write tests per spec | sonnet | Run tests, modify implementation |
| @test-runner | Run tests, report results | sonnet | Fix failures, modify code |
| @qc-agent | Verify against spec + invariants | opus | Modify anything |
| @github-ops | Git operations, PRs | sonnet | Write code or tests |
| @doc-writer | Documentation only | sonnet | Modify code |
| @research | Technical investigation | sonnet | Implement, make decisions |

**Core principle:** No agent verifies their own work.

---

## Orchestration Flow

Every implementation slice follows this sequence:

```
1. @code-executor  → Implements the slice
   ├── Automated gates: lint, format, type check (baked in)
   └── PASS → Continue | FAIL → Fix or HALT

2. @test-writer    → Writes tests for the slice
   ├── Automated gates: compile, smoke test (baked in)
   └── PASS → Continue | FAIL → Fix or HALT

3. @test-runner    → Runs tests + coverage check
   ├── Coverage threshold from INVARIANTS.md
   ├── PASS + Coverage met → Continue to QC
   └── FAIL or Coverage low → Advisor diagnoses

4. @qc-agent       → Deep review (spec compliance)
   ├── Prerequisites: All automated gates passed
   ├── PASS → Continue to Final Check
   └── VIOLATIONS → Advisor re-delegates

5. Forge Advisor   → Final Check
   ├── Verify all gates passed
   ├── Verify tests + coverage
   ├── STAMP: APPROVED → proceed
   └── STAMP: SEND BACK → re-route to agent

6. @github-ops     → Commits (optional, per workflow)
```

## Integration with Spec Orchestration

Forge consumes the 5 spec documents:

```
docs/specs/{feature}/
├── 01-REQUIREMENTS.md   → Acceptance criteria for QC
├── 02-ARCHITECTURE.md   → Patterns, schemas for @code-executor
├── 03-UI-SPEC.md        → Layouts, flows for @code-executor
├── 04-ROADMAP.md        → Slices for Forge Advisor to sequence
└── 05-REVIEW.md         → Risks, assumptions to watch for
```

Contracts reference these documents:
- "Per 02-ARCHITECTURE.md §Data Schemas..."
- "Per 04-ROADMAP.md Slice 2..."

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
./install.sh

# Start a forge session (after specs are approved)
claude
/forge-start

# Point to the spec directory
> Build from docs/specs/model-viewer/
```

## Governance Documents

Your project should have:

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context, conventions | Project root |
| `INVARIANTS.md` | Inviolable rules | `docs/` |
| `CADENCE.md` | Workflow phases | `docs/` |

Templates provided in `templates/`.

---

## HALT Conditions

Agents HALT (don't guess) when:
- Specification is ambiguous
- Required input is missing
- Constraint would be violated
- Decision exceeds their authority

HALTs are **success** — they surface problems before they compound.
